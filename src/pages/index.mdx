  <h2 slot="title">About Me</h2>
  <p slot="first"> I'm Clayton Cook, a software engineer with a strong focus on frontend development utilizing React. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Saginaw Valley State University](https://www.svsu.edu/), expected to graduate in winter 2025. Concurrently, I work remotely as a contractor for [Cellar Door](https://cellar-door.io/), a reputable consulting company, where I contribute to various frontend development projects. Notably, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with distinguished organizations such as [TIAA Bank](https://www.tiaabank.com/), an American diversified financial services company, and [Peleton](https://www.onepeloton.com/), a renowned American exercise equipment and media enterprise. Beyond my professional endeavors, I enjoy exploring digital art and nurturing my passion for computer engineering during my leisure time.</p>
