		&emsp;Hi, my name is Clayton and I'm currently a <span class="important">Computer Science Major</span> going for my <a href="https://www.svsu.edu/">Bachelors at Saginaw Valley State Univerity</a>. I originally started programming in high school with my brother making websites and games using <span class="important">HTML, CSS, and Javascript</span>. Eventually I started dabbling in <span class="important">Angular and JQuery</span> and learned a lot but eventually settled on <span class="important">React and Svelte</span> as my primary tools. However, I have independantly studied languages like <span class="important">Java, Python, C#, C/C++, etc</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		&emsp;Alongside programming, I also enjoy <span class="important">circuitry, digital art, and creating music</span>. You can also find me volunteering for different programs such as <a href="https://www.soinc.org/">Science Olympiad</a> to help other younger students get interested in the world of science.
	</p>
	<p>
		&emsp;Currently, I'm looking for am <span class="important">internship or even junior frontend developer position</span>. If you think I'd be a good fit for your team, take a look at my <a href="/resume">resume</a> and set up an appointment to talk to me via my <a href="https://calendly.com/claytonleonardcook/30min">Calendly</a>.
